<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Shalom! I am from Enugu, Nigeria, and I am the founder of Words Of Wisdom (WOW movement).<br />
   I started WOW because I have a strong passion for words and the positive effect Right Words have on longing souls, and wanted to inspire others to start expanding the ripple effects of encouragement, too.<br />
   After many years of trying to find a job that reflected my love for encouraging others with right words, 
   I decided to take matters into my own hands and start my own organisation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>WOW is an all-in-one encouragement community where everyone from people seeking right words and people seeking to share can both find inspiration and help inspire others.<br />
    In the wow community everyone is permitted to express themselves and encorage others with words.
  </p>
   

  <p> Since I started WOW in 2015, it’s quickly become one of the most popular encouragement platforms online, with more than 5,000,000 subscribers worldwide.
   I’ve been in your shoes before, seeking for genuine words of encouragement so here at WOW my goal is to help you achieve your dreams, by providing the right environment to be listened to whatever you may have to say be.
